"""
1) Syntax - Lists use [], tuples use ()

2) Mutability - Elements in a given list are mutable, 
elements in a given tuple are NOT mutable.

3) Hashtables (Dictionaries) - As hashtables (dictionaries) 
require that its keys are hashable and therefore immutable,
only tuples can act as dictionary keys, not lists.
